# Data-Science-Portfolio
Reference repository of my data science, process automation and other work in Python.

### PCA-research_paper folder
The PCA-research_paper folder contains some samples from the research paper I co-authored titled "A Spectral Decomposition of the Credit Default Swap Indices" (submitted to Physica A on July 13 2019, available: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3419188)

- **cds_pca.py**: the main PCA calculation file that does the backbone calculation of the paper. Main Python libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Scypy, Sklear.
- **pl_plot.py**: plotting the profit/loss standard deviation of the index VS the portfolios resulted from the PCA runs.

- **pl_dist_plot.py**: plotting the profit/loss disctribution of the PCA index vs the names in each PCA runs.
